The most well-liked PHP programming environment for Linux, Windows, and OS X is Xampp.
A software distribution server called Xampp, which stands for Cross platform(x), Apache(a), Maria db(m), PHP(p), and Pearl(p), makes it easier for developers to test and release their work by setting up a local web server.

Note:
If the MySQL is not running. Go to task manager->services and Search for MySQL running in background, if it is found stop the MySQL and start again MySQL from Xampp.
